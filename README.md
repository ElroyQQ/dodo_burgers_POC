# Dodo Burgers

A single-page, single-file website for **Dodo Burgers** — a fictional Singapore burger restaurant built around a whimsical premise: the dodo didn't go extinct in 1681, it quietly evolved into an aquatic species and was rediscovered in 2019 in the shallows off Singapore's Tuas reclaimed land.

The site is a complete, self-contained deliverable: no build step, no framework, no dependencies. Open `index.html` in a browser and it runs.

## Quick start

```bash
open index.html
```

Or serve it locally (needed if you want relative image paths to behave exactly as they will on a real host):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

There is no npm install, no bundler, and no test suite — see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the code architecture if you're editing this with an AI coding agent.

## What's on the page

- **Hero** — headline, copy, and a composited photo of the dodo swimming at the Tuas waterfront at sunset.
- **"Why us, specifically"** — three short cards making the differentiation pitch (unique species, not a commodity, locally "reclaimed").
- **Field log** — a short in-universe "declassified" backstory section.
- **Menu** — four burgers, each with a real product photo, description, and an "Add to order" button that adds to the cart.
- **Build Your Own** — fully photo-driven picker: click a photo of a patty/bun/sauce/topping to select it (single-select for patty/bun/sauce, multi-select for toppings), with a live running total and a summary panel.
- **FAQ** — accordion, including a taste comparison to Singaporean dishes and a halal-certification question.
- **Cart drawer** — slide-out panel with running total and a "Send to kitchen" action (front-end only — see [Scope and limitations](#scope-and-limitations)).

## Design system

- **Theme**: light/cream (`--paper` background, white `--card` surfaces), not dark mode. Teal (`--teal-700`) is the brand accent for links/labels; coral (`--coral-500`) is the call-to-action color.
- **Type**: Fredoka (headings), Manrope (body), Space Mono (labels/prices/data), all loaded from Google Fonts.
- **Imagery policy**: every image on the site is a real photograph, licensed for free/commercial use, edited as needed (cropped, color-graded, composited) — no illustrations or AI-generated imagery, with one deliberate exception: see [Your build preview](#your-build-preview) below. See [Image credits](#image-credits) for everything else.

**`hero.jpg` and `logo.jpg` are original composites**, not stock photos, built with Python/Pillow from two source images:
1. **Background** — a sunset photo of a Singapore container port jetty, by Kharl Anthony Paica (Pexels), standing in for the Tuas waterfront.
2. **Dodo subject** — *"Dronte dodo Raphus cucullatus.jpg"*, a photograph of a real plaster-and-wax dodo reconstruction model held by the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris, by Jebulon, via Wikimedia Commons (**CC0 / public domain**). This is a photo of a physical museum model, not an illustration — since no photos of a live dodo exist, this is the most accurate real-photo option.

The compositing (cutting the dodo out of its studio background, scaling it, color-grading it to match the scene's dusk backlighting, adding a waterline fade, reflection, and contact shadow) was done in this session with Pillow/numpy — see the "Session history" section of [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for how that pipeline works and what was tried before landing on the current version.

### "Your build" preview

The one deliberate exception to the photo-only policy: the small burger graphic in the "Build Your Own" summary panel is a **generated SVG illustration**, not a photo. It's built in JavaScript (`renderBuilderPreview()` in `index.html`) from the current selections — bun, patty, sauce, and toppings each map to a drawn layer — and redraws itself on every change, with each layer animating in with a short staggered drop-in. A static or per-combination photo isn't possible here (there's no photo for every one of the dozens of possible ingredient combinations), so this one spot uses illustration on purpose, per an explicit request.

## Scope and limitations

This is a front-end demo/prototype, not a working ordering system:
- The cart is in-memory JavaScript state — it resets on page reload and is not shared between visitors.
- "Send to kitchen" clears the cart and shows a confirmation toast; it does not submit anywhere or process any payment.
- There is no backend, no real menu/pricing system, and no real restaurant behind this — it's a fictional brand built for the exercise of designing and building a full interactive site.

## Deployment

The site is also published as a Claude Artifact for easy sharing/preview: https://claude.ai/artifact/UhUgz4eWVWqZ5nwshgQxX6 (private by default — only accessible to people it's been explicitly shared with).

To host it for real, `index.html` plus the `images/` folder is everything that's needed — any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3, etc.) will work as-is, no build step required.
