# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A single self-contained static website for "Dodo Burgers," a fictional Singapore burger restaurant. The whole site — markup, CSS, and JavaScript — lives in one file: `index.html`, plus a flat `images/` folder of photos it references by relative path. There is no build step, no package manager, and no dependencies to install. See [README.md](README.md) for the project-level overview, feature list, and full image credits.

## Running it

Open `index.html` directly in a browser (double-click it, or `open index.html` on macOS), or serve the folder (`python3 -m http.server`) if you want to sanity-check relative paths the way a real host would serve them. There is no dev server, bundler, linter, or test suite configured in this repo.

## Architecture

Everything is inline in `index.html`, in three blocks in this order:

1. **`<style>`** — all CSS, using custom properties on `:root` (`--paper`, `--card`, `--ink-900`, `--teal-700`, `--coral-500`, etc.) for a light/cream theme with teal as the brand accent and coral as the CTA color. There is no dark-mode variant — the page commits to one light theme.
2. **Markup** — header/nav, hero section (photo, not illustration), a "why us" section, a "field log" story section, a menu grid, a burger builder, an FAQ, a footer, and the cart drawer/overlay markup.
3. **`<script>`** — a single IIFE containing all interactivity, with no external JS libraries:
   - `MENU`, `BUILDER` (patty/bun/sauce/topping options, each with an `img` field), and `FAQ` are static data arrays/objects near the top of the script — edit these to change menu items, prices, builder options, or FAQ copy.
   - `cart` (array) and `build` (object) hold the running state for the order cart and the burger-builder selections, respectively.
   - Render functions (`renderMenu`, `renderBuilder`, `renderFaq`, `renderCart`, `renderPillRow`) rebuild their DOM section from the data/state above; there is no framework or virtual DOM, so these fully re-render their target element on every state change. Note: `renderPillRow` is the historical name — it now renders clickable **photo swatches** (`.swatch` elements), not text pills; see Session history below.
   - The cart is in-memory only (no `localStorage`/backend) — it resets on page reload, and "Send to kitchen" just clears the cart and shows a toast rather than submitting anywhere.

Fonts (Fredoka, Manrope, Space Mono) are loaded from Google Fonts via `<link>` tags at the top of the file.

## Image policy

**Every image on this site must be a real, freely-licensed photograph, edited as needed — never an illustration, drawing, or AI-generated image.** This was an explicit, repeated instruction from the project owner. When adding or changing imagery:
- Source from Pexels (Pexels License, free for commercial use) or another clearly free/CC0 source (e.g. Wikimedia Commons).
- Photo edits (cropping, color grading, compositing multiple photos together with Pillow/numpy) are fine and expected — the `images/hero.jpg` and `images/logo.jpg` files are original composites built this way.
- Record credits in the footer of `index.html` and in [README.md](README.md#image-credits) when adding new sourced images.

**One explicit exception**: the "Your build" preview in the builder section (`renderBuilderPreview()`) is a generated SVG illustration, not a photo — the project owner specifically asked for an animated illustration there so it can redraw itself per ingredient combination, which a fixed set of photos can't do. Don't treat this as license to reintroduce illustrations elsewhere; it's a one-spot, explicitly requested carve-out.

## Session history

Summary of the major changes made in the most recent working session, in order, for context on *why* the site looks the way it does:

1. **Initial build** — dark ocean/lagoon-themed site with hand-drawn SVG illustrations (a dodo mascot, burger cross-section art) and a fictional backstory (rediscovered aquatic dodo off Singapore's Tuas reclaimed land).
2. **Burgers → real photos** — replaced the illustrated SVG burgers with licensed Pexels photos per item, on explicit instruction to stop using illustrations for anything food-related.
3. **Singaporean copy pass** — rewrote copy (FAQ, menu descriptions, footer) with local flavor after researching real Singapore burger sites for tone (e.g. Fatboy's, Two Blur Guys, The Goodburger) — added sambal/salted-egg/laksa/chilli-crab menu language, a halal-certification FAQ, and Tuas Link MRT references. Re-themed the whole site from dark to a light/cream palette on request.
4. **Dodo illustration → real photo** — replaced the SVG dodo mascot with a photo composite: since no photos of a live dodo exist, sourced a CC0 photo of an actual museum plaster/wax dodo reconstruction (Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris) and composited it against a real sunset photo of a Singapore port. Iterated through a few treatments (a "pinned field-specimen photo" collage, a mangrove-habitat composite to look more "alive" than a museum piece) before landing on the current version.
5. **Interactive builder** — converted "Build Your Own" from text/radio pill buttons to a fully photo-driven picker: sourced 13 individual ingredient photos (3 patties, 3 buns, 3 sauces, 4 toppings) so each option is a clickable image swatch with a selected-state checkmark, instead of a text label.
6. **Dodo compositing refinement** — moved the dodo from a separate "pinned photo" overlay to directly swimming in the water of the hero photo, at a corrected (much smaller, believable) scale relative to the background pier/cranes. Then fixed the lighting: the dodo sits in the same backlit position as the photo's pier posts (foreground, between camera and the low sun), so it needed to read as a near-silhouette with a thin warm rim light — not an evenly-lit studio cutout. Built with a proper multiply/screen-blend lighting pipeline (numpy) rather than flat color tinting, which preserves the subject's texture instead of flattening it.
7. **Docs + "your build" preview** — added README.md and this session-history section; removed the Singlish "lah" from the hero headline (back to "Extinct in 1681. Back on the menu now."); replaced the static `images/builder.jpg` photo in the builder summary with a generated, animated SVG illustration (`renderBuilderPreview()`) that redraws from the current bun/patty/sauce/topping selection on every change — the one explicit exception to the photo-only image policy above.

If asked to touch the hero image again, read the "Image policy" section above first, and know that getting the lighting/scale to match the background photo is the hard part — see point 6 for what worked.
